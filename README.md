   ```
4. **Switch to Your Branch**:
   If you have already created your branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout <your-name>
   ```

## **Submission Guidelines**

### 1. **Folder Structure**:
   Ensure your submissions follow this folder structure:
   ```
   <your-name>/
       assignments/
           assignment-1/
               <your-files>
           assignment-2/
               <your-files>
       quizzes/
           quiz-1/
               <your-files>
           quiz-2/
               <your-files>
       practicals/
           practical-1/
               <your-files>
           practical-2/
               <your-files>
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   john-doe/
       assignments/
           assignment-1/
               App.js
               README.md
       quizzes/
           quiz-1/
               solution.js
       practicals/
           practical-1/
               demo-code.js
   ```

### 2. **Commit Messages**:
   Use meaningful commit messages for each submission. Examples:
   - "Added assignment 1: React components."
   - "Updated quiz 2 solution."

   Commands to commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your meaningful message"
   ```

### 3. **Push to Your Branch**:
   After making your changes and committing them:
   ```bash
   git push origin <your-name>
   ```

## **Evaluation Process**
1. Ensure your code is well-structured and properly commented.
2. Submit your code before the specified deadline.
3. The instructor will review your submissions directly from your branch.
4. Feedback will be provided via comments or code review in your branch.

---

## **Best Practices**
- **Write Clean Code**: Follow standard coding practices and include comments where necessary.
- **Test Your Code**: Ensure your code runs without errors before submission.
- **Follow Deadlines**: Late submissions might not be evaluated.
- **Use README Files**: For each assignment/practical/quiz folder, include a `README.md` file with a brief description of your solution and how to run it.
